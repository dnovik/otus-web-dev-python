    <p>She'll turn cold as a freezer. At the eh-end of it all. Stinging like a bee I earned my stripes. Bikinis, zucchinis, Martinis, no weenies. I hope you got a healthy appetite. We can dance, until we die, you and I, will be young forever. We're living the life. We're doing it right. Word on the street, you got somethin' to show me, me.
      Wanna see the show in 3D, a movie. They say, be afraid you're not like the others, futuristic lover. Open up your heart. So I sat quietly, agreed politely. Last Friday night. Yeah, you're lucky if you're on her plane. I'll be your gift, give you something good to celebrate.
